    <h1>My Favorite Pet</h1>
    <h2>Simple description of a pet</h2>
    <p class="intro">A pet is an <strong>animal or a bird</strong> kept at home for plessure
      rather than the one kept for work or food. This is done World Wide at the moment.
    Different people have different taste as usual.</p>
    <p>Here are some of the reasons why I love having a pet</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pets can help manage loneliness and depression by giving us companionship.</li>
      <li>Some even offer security</li>
      <li>Regular walking or playing with pets can decrease blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and triglyceride levels.</li>
      <li>They can increase opportunities to exercise, get outside, and socialize.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I have continously developed passion towards dogs from my childhood to date.</p>
    <p>Below is a clear picture of my good looking already grown dog.</p>

    <p>I have no doubt that having a pet like mine is fun.</p>
    <p>He is a male dog with some of unique characters including feeding habit.</p>
    <h3>Here are some of his unique characteristics</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Courageous</li>
      <li>Intelligent</li>
      <li>Loyal guard</li>
      <li>Good tempered</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The easiest way to improve your mood - and your life - is to take time each day to focus on the
      simple things that bring you joy. To that end, I have decided with to bring you
      uplifting, feel-good stories about my pet each day. Take a few minutes to read something happy. And don't forget
      to share your own bit of good experience on social media for the World to know more about pets.
    </p>
    <p>Dogs are the best because, unlike people (and most cats), they love you unconditionally. ... Dogs are willing to put
      aside their differences and live in peace, even with their natural-born enemies. Owning a dog can help kids learn about
      responsibility and empathy. They love to snuggle and they're the best at it.</p>
      <p>Dogs get so excited over the simplest things – sticks, discarded food wrappers, a trip to the corner shop – that they
        make you appreciate the little things in life. No one can be sad with a waggy-tailed friend around.</p>
